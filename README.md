# Tristan Smith - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, my name's Tristan, I'm a psychology graduate with a passion for numbers and analytics. I'm excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a hunger for working with stats/analytics. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

Recently in my free time I've been exploring new data analysis tools and techniques to break into the data analytics field. So far I've developed a proficiency working with Python, SQL, PowerBI and some basic knowledge of Tableau.

Here's a link to my CV in PDF format: xyz

In this repository I'll be showcasing some of the projects I've worked on within the data analytics / data science fields.
